# ESE 2018 Team 7

This Repo was developed for the [ESE course at the University of Bern](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese).

## How to run
Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed, then you can run the [install.sh](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2018-team7/blob/master/install.sh) script. For further runs you can use the [start.sh](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2018-team7/blob/master/start.sh) script.

The frontend should open automatically, else you can find it under [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

The backend runs at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but it should't be necessary to view that.

The system uses a SQLite Database

## Technologies
We use a number of different technologies. Some of them are:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): Everything is written in Typescript
- [Angular 6](https://angular.io/): The frontend is build with Angular
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/): The design is heavily based on Angular Material
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/): All the time/date stuff is managed with Moment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com): The backend is build with Express
- [Express Session](https://github.com/expressjs/session): To handle user login cookies we use Express Session
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): Database for this project
- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/): ORM to connect to the SQLite Database
- [Bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js): Library to securely hash your password
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
